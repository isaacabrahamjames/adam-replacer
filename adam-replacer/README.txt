I had a friend called adam
I would write in a brackety language
but without the brackets
and adam would put the brackets in with varying success

adam was simple

i replaced adam with adam-replacer

like adam, adam replacer adds the brackets in where they need to be...

ussually

also like adam, adam replacer doesnt work if u want to multiply :(

and like adam, adam replacer is an utter mess
